# realtime_fruit_ripeness
The Fruit Ripeness Prediction System is an end-to-end computer vision application that classifies fruit images into **Fresh**, **Okay (Unripe)**, or **Avoid (Rotten)** categories.   The project demonstrates the complete machine learning lifecycle — from data preprocessing and model training to deployment and real-time inference via a web interface.
